    Task 1:
    Implement a clustering algorithm to group similar code submissions using an ML method like k-means.
    This will help identify clusters of highly similar code for further investigation.

"""
    Task 5:
    If we were to create a graph that shows each submitted code
    as a point with clusters plotted in the XY plane,
    what are your thoughts and ideas on how we should approach this visualization?
    Any suggestions on useful metrics or dimensions to represent?
